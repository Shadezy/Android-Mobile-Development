# Android-Mobile-Development
Miscellaneous projects from my CSCD372 Android Mobile Development Class. There are some random small projects in here that highlight certain parts of mobile development. Animation timers, life cycle, preferences, drawers, intents, etc.

Installation: If you have an android device, simplay enable developer options and allow your phone to install apps from unknown sources, and then download the apk from whichever project and put it on your phone and run it. If you wish to use an emulator, then do the same steps, but on that instead.

Lab0: Intro project to create a one page app to do essentially nothing.

Lab1: Use intents to pass info from one page to another and display different things depending on the given info.

Lab2: Created a nav drawer with pictures that can display the picture you tap.

Lab3: Made an expandable list view that held info about the make and model of certain cars, along with their pictures. The data is retrieved by looking through a folder for specific pictures and info. The picutres are not included in github, because it made the project too large.

Lab4: Created a dynamic seven set display that uses a canvas.

Lab5: Created an analog clock that uses an animation timer and uses observers.

Lab6: Built off of lab3 that used fragments. Changed it so this project used a custom adapter instead of the built in one. Some other functionality includes being able to delete entries, and swiping left and right to go between pages.

Lab7: A more robust clock that has a settings menu that lets you do things such as change the picture, partial seconds as opposed to whole ones, and 24hr time or 12hr time.

Lab8: Used the google maps api to create a maps app that lets you mark and delete your current location. Some things get printed out that shouldn't.

Midterm: A Tic-tac-toe game I made using images that you drag and drop. There is no completion functionality, however.
